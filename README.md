# EvoluMonitor

The convergence and divergence of existing product in the market are long-term processes. Research literatures, Patent records, and custormer reviews are the main resource of the metrics that can be used to predict the future of market. I am working on new text-bases analysis to provide conclusive results to monitor diffusion of features of prodcts. Convergence and divergence of the existing products in the market. The ultimate goal of my project is developing new methods to predict the evolution of new functionalities using texts and other available nonlinear models.

As a starting point, I focused on customer reviews about headphone on Amazon. I have extracted all the reviews about 15 renowned headphone brands and extracted mainly discussed topics as features and produced a table of brand-feature satisfaction. This table shows the extent of satisfaction in user experience using each brand on each specific feature. For the headphone I ended up with features like battery life, bass response, noise cancellation, noise isolation, bluetooth. Moreover, I applied k-mean as a clustering method to the reviews to limit the scope of analysis to find the reviews regarding each feature. The next steps are LDA (latend dirichlet allocation) to topic modeling for the reviews. At the next step, I will apply context-aware text analysis to get main problems using each feature.
